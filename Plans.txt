1. Improve the Transformer (or find another) to work better on this project
2. Find new way to output image file (value based, not position) so that grayscale can work
    Note: values of 0 currently do not work
3. Create a method to input grayscale, not only binary
4. Improve accuracy
5. What if we don't use the same speckle patterns each time? Is there a correlation between speckle patterns and bucket intensity we don't know? This would likely have dependence on the object itself
6. data compression?
