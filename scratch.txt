Folder introduction:
Image is two set of picturesâ€” number pic and smiling face pic, which can be read and showdirectly by python
Result is sets of result of deep leaning network picture
N_result is also sets of DL results but it is the result with artificial noise Programe introduction
ittle_exm.py is the main program where you can adjust the network parameters
When you wanna to try all the program, run this

model_train_construct.py & transformer_badge.py the main functions of transformer network, do not need to adjust, watch some introduction of transformer in YouTube may help to understand
copy_from_past.py the functions about data process and so on which need to be change according to the ability you want to achieve
n_little_exm.py just a test program to test the noisy network, ignore it.
Explanation about function in detail:
Batch: generate the specified type of data which network need
LoadData & DealDataset: process mnist picture
LoadModel: when you wanna load a trained model, use it
trasnFcn: a function adjust the size of pic
npySave:save tensor(torch) matrix
show_result: no use, which for test a old version network
greedy_show & greedy_decode: use greedy algorithm to guess result, which used to output result
trg_dealwith: process the data to type which can be accepted by transformer network
src_dealwith: process the data to type which can be accepted by transformer network
run_epoch: the main function which start train process
